a little project i did for my computer science because i couldn't find an easy way to create a demonstration for my (real life) wheel,
this entire thing is horribly coded so things might break (i'll fix it if anyone makes an issue)

currently implemented: 
  decoding (for my version of the wheel),
  encoding (also my version),
  generating OTPs (file support also),
  the quit button (wow),

probably will be implemented: 
  removal of the need for the console,
  make it a .exe (maybe),
  live encoding (maybe also decoding),

feel free to use anything on here idc

also cool website i found on this: https://programmingpraxis.com/2014/12/19/diana-cryptosystem/#comment-43021
